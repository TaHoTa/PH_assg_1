                Do you struggle with reaching your goals? One thing that makes goals so difficult to achieve is that
                it’s hard to stay focused enough to keep working towards them.

                    Elsewhere, their findings discovered that households want to spend less money on grocery shopping,
                    have fewer takeaways, and also save on phone and broadband costs. Setting resolutions can help you
                    get off to a good start in 2022, however it's important to think of measurable goals that you can
                    actually track and achieve.

                    "Looking at the resolutions for 2022, it's clear that both mental and physical wellbeing are still
                    at the top of the list for a significant amount of people," says Richard Jones, head of money at
                    GoCompare. "With numerous lockdowns and an ongoing global health pandemic, it's perhaps no surprise
                    that mental and physical health remain big priorities for Brits.

                <p>
                    "Another key theme in peoples' financial resolutions is the need to cut back on expenditure, with
                    groceries and takeaways being one of the major areas for saving money. With inflation costs
                    continuing to increase, it's no surprise that people are looking to save on their outgoings next
                    year."

                Further, she highlighted the mistake people make while making New Year’s resolutions. “The mistake
                people make with resolutions is that they go into it with the mindset that the change will be temporary.
                If you really want to be happier or have an improved lifestyle, the changes you make need to become
                habits. Not all of them have to be big adjustments, either. If you turn a small lifestyle change into a
                habit, you could see a HUGE difference.”

                in the first meeting of the FBCCI Standing Committee on Ports and Shipping today.
